GLOBAL SCOPE:(EXAMPLE)

Global scope
Variables defined outside of any function have global scope.
These variables can be accessed from anywhere in the code, both inside and outside functions.

CODE:


global_var = 10

def my_function():
    print(global_var)  # Accessing the global variable

print(global_var)  # Accessible here
my_function()
